/****************************************************************************
Instead of working directly with the Response object, we return an object derived from the
ActionResult class that describes what we want the response from our controller to be, such as rendering
a view or redirecting to another URL or action method.

The MVC Framework contains a number of built-in action result types
(see ActionResults1.png and ActionResults2.png)
