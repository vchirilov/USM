/****************************************************************************
Most of the time developers will create controllers by extending from System.Web.Mvc.Controller

The Controller class provides three key features:
	Action methods
	Action results
	Filters

When you create a controller by deriving from the Controller base class, you get access to 
a set of convenience properties to access informationabout the request. 
These properties include Request, Response, RouteData, HttpContext, and Server

(have a look at ControllerContext.png)
