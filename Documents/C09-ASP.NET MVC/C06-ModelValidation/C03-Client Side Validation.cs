/*************************************************************************************************
In Web applications, users typically expect immediate validation feedbackâ€”without having to submit
anything to the server. This is known as client-side validation and is usually implemented using
JavaScript.

The MVC Framework supports unobtrusive client-side validation. The term unobtrusive means that
validation rules are expressed using attributes added to the HTML elements that we generate. 
These attributes are interpreted by a JavaScript library that is included as part of the MVC Framework that, in
turn, relies configures the jQuery Validation library, which does the actual validation work.
